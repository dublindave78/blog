So the right to bear arms. First off I want to say I am disgusted and sickendd by the e vents in Texas.
Kids are special they are the future they are not suipposed to suffer liek this. But we have the right rto bear arms for a reason.
You ever notice and circling back to post one. How we have bases everywhere in the world and only we do.
You know why we dont need an army here. Because god dammit we have 150,000,000 adults who if we were ever attacked
not race, religion, who or what you prefer to be touching your private parts or what you call your self.
Shoulder to shoudler picking off the enemy we would stand. To take our guns creates an open invitation for military law and incvasion.
Thats just how it is, and not once has a fucking politician, stood at a mike and owned taht. And any president that takes the guns away
Well contribute to the falling iof this country.

As for Texas, Im glad he is dead thats fine, but the parents the school officials they soudl all be debriefed and in a hiostile manner . They missed
This shit and if they didnt and they over looked it , well they should be charged with murder in every death yeasterday. See I know I  am a fucking lounatic
my kids arent far off, but yet they were raised in a different amanenr and they were given tools to over come things I wasnt.I never even spanked them but yet
great kids. So parenmting and the way you are raised is what moulds you, his family his teachers, whoever was close to him , helped create him. A monster
don't care he could of walked in with a machete or a rambioo knife and done hjust as much damage.

May those kids have better luck next time around. Because I believe we live in a loop that one is next.
